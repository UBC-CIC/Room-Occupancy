          The UBC Cloud Innovation Center seeks a cutting-edge solution to address the challenge of real-time people counting and occupancy monitoring in spaces, such as rooms or traffic areas. This solution should utilize IoT devices, an open-source image processor, and cloud services to accurately count and track the number of people in these areas. The data gathered should be presented via a user-friendly interface that efficiently conveys information.
